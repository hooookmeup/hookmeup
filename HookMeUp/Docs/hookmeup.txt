So you do understand why I designed the tables the way I did right? I just did it to 1. to get the data required to draw the UI for the questions part

2. To store the data for the Location based stuff

3. To store data for Ads etc. based on usage

and 4. to help International

So if we are able to do this with any other DB design, I am good.

It does not have to be done in this way only. As long as we can is the need
